# AdHocLib: Android library for ad hoc network.

AdHocLib version 1.0.1

### What is AdHocLib?

AdHocLib is a library which allows to create and manage ad hoc connections on Android mobile devices. It is designed for my master thesis at the Université de Liège (Montefiore Institute). It works both with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct technologies. It is compatible with Android Minimum SDK 16 (Android 4.1 - JELLY_BEAN).

Its interface offers the following basic functionalities:
  - create an ad hoc network;
  - join an ad hoc network;
  - leave an ad hoc network;
  - send data to a destination (using routing algorithm if needed);
  - forward data to another node (using routing algorithm if needed);
  - broadcast data to all neighbours;
  - provides notifications to applications using the library when a specific event has occurred.
